# Social-Network-API

## Description

This is the backend construction of a social networking application. The backend code will enable an application to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) users as well as thoughts and reactions.

## Usage

The application will need to be accessed through the use of programs such as Insomnia to use the established end points for database manipulation.

## Collaborators

Instructional staff helped with adding friends logic.

## Installation

You must download the application code from the repository and clone it to your local machine. After the code has been cloned to your machine, you can then type 'npm install' in the directory of that repository to have access to the dependencies for this application to work. You must also have mongodb installed on your machine so that you may initialize a database when the application is started through the CLI command 'npm start'.
